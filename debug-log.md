//I can't get the adafruit powered. I think I have the right wiring but I'm not sure how to actually get the LED to display light.
//Look up sample Adafruit code.
//Ohhhhh download Adafruit library and run sample code
//JD added a transistor
//LED still will not display light
//I have to connect third wire to AO
//The sample code displays various LED light arrangements but I only want a specific light arrangement. How do I know which code does what?
//I need to change RGB values by changing the values of -->strip.setPixelColor(i, strip.Color(0,0,0, gamma[j] ) );
//Sensor needs a for loop to work properly. How do I calculate the distance needed to run code?
//Open up serial port and view the values presented when I raise my hand up and down over the sensor. (around 100)
//weak and varying brightness?
