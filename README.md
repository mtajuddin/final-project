I created a pulsing light arrangement based on the wave of a hand. The pulsing light arrangement was to be placed in a wire and tracing paper enclosure. Figuring out how the Adafruit LEDs are powered proved difficult. At first I thought maybe the LED needed a battery pack or something other than my computer. I discovered that I could power my LED through electricity from my laptop. Soldering jumper wires to the LED was exhilarating! The process of soldering made microcontrollers and exposed electronics less foreign. Now when I see broken electronics I look at them with greater understanding of what goes into producing them. Setting up the proximity sensor was fun because I had a feeling that I would need a loop for the sensor and I realized that I was correct. This project exposed me to programming and electronics in a way I never expected. This class and project have inspired me to continue learning about programming and electronic devices/robots this summer.
